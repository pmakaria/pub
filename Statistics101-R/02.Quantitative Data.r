#Alternative Solution
#We create an interpolate function Fn with the built-in function ecdf. Then we plot Fn right away. 
#There is no need to compute the cumulative frequency distribution a priori.

#Enhanced Solution
#We can generate a linear regression model of the two variables with the lm function, and then draw a trend line with abline.
